### Description

#### Idea Behind This Project

When deciding on learning something new in my opinion coming up with the amount of hours you want to commit and having a future date as deadline or milestone can really help in helping commiting and staying consistent on your goals. 

Points can be made that this could help with..

* Being more self-conscious of your time, (be more efficient)
* Focus on what needs to be done now to reach that goal
* Helps to stay commited
* Not putting things of to a later future
